# middle-manager

*The no bullshit presentation tool*

---

## Write your slides in **markdown**

### *What is markdown?*

A simple markup language. Checkout this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [the source of this presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idris-maps/middle-manager/master/demo/demo.md).

### *How are the slides separated?*

With three dashes.

## Cut the bullshit

We help you be clear, concise and avoid unnecessary fluff. `middle-manager` always shows you a *bullshit score*â„¢, ranking the amount of bullshit in your presentation between 0 and 1000.

To see which words are nonsense, add the `-bs` flag to your command.

```bash
middle-manager -md my-presentation.md -o my-presentation.html -bs
```

They will be replaced by the literal word *bullshit*.

We would love to pretend the *bullshit detector*â„¢ is based on our proprietary AI

...but it did not pass said detector. It uses the, nonetheless excellent, [bullshit.js](https://mourner.github.io/bullshit.js/)

## Markdown tables are a pain

Use `csv`,`tsv` or `dsv` code blocks instead.

```csv
